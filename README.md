Implementation of Learnable Aggregator for Graph Convolutional Networks in TensorFlow.

![LA-GCN with Mask Aggregator](https://github.com/asarigun/LA-GCN/blob/main/images/model.jpg)

Learnable Aggregator for GCN (LA-GCN) by introducing a shared auxiliary model that provides a
customized schema in neighborhood aggregation. Under this framework, a new model proposed called
LA-GCN(Mask) consisting of a new aggregator function, mask aggregator. The auxiliary model
learns a specific mask for each neighbor of a given node, allowing both node-level and feature-level 
attention. This mechanism learns to assign different importance to both nodes and features for prediction, 
which provides interpretable explanations for prediction and increases the model robustness. [1]<!--[[1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3411983)]-->

## Requirements
* tensorflow_version 1.x

## Training

```bash
python train.py
```
You can also try out in colab if you don't have any requirements!  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XtLxuk0zJKxC0Ee2gMscqtAHaUIYLSH8?usp=sharing)

Note: Since random inits, your training results may not exact the same as reported in the paper!

## Data

In order to use your own data, you have to provide 
* an N by N adjacency matrix (N is the number of nodes), 
* an N by D feature matrix (D is the number of features per node), and
* an N by E binary label matrix (E is the number of classes). [2]<!--[[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)]-->

Have a look at the `load_data()` function in `utils.py` for an example.

In this example, we load citation network data (Cora, Citeseer or Pubmed). The original datasets can be found here: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sen/lbc-proj/LBC.html. In our version (see `data` folder) we use dataset splits provided by https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid (Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, [Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08861), ICML 2016). 

You can specify a dataset by editing `train.py`
<!--
You can specify a dataset as follows: -->
<!--
* For Citeseer: 
```bash
python train.py --dataset citeseer
```
* For Cora: 
```bash
python train.py --dataset cora
```
* For Pubmed: 
```bash
python train.py --dataset pubmed
``` 
(or by editing `train.py`) -->

## Models

You can choose between the following models: 
* `gcn_mask`: Learnable Aggregator for Graph Convolutional Networks (Li  Zhang ,Haiping  Lu, [A Feature-Importance-Aware and Robust Aggregator for GCN](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3411983), CIKM 2020) 
* `gcn`: Graph convolutional network (Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907), 2016)
* `gcn_cheby`: Chebyshev polynomial version of graph convolutional network as described in (MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, Pierre Vandergheynst, [Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), NIPS 2016)
<!--* `dense`: Basic multi-layer perceptron that supports sparse inputs-->
